# How to build
<sub>For the "i dont trust random executable file", "there is detection on virtustotal", etc.

- Make sure you are on Windows 10 or higher.
- You have MinGW-w64 on your system.
- Clone this repo.
- Command to build:
```cpp
g++ main.cpp -o sublime_text_crack.exe

// Optional: build with all the libary linked to the executable
g++ main.cpp -o sublime_text_crack.exe -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
```

# Disclaimer

This is purely intended for education and I against the idea of using this for the purpose of pirating Sublime Text. You should pay for a license to support Sublime HQ. ~($99 for a text editor remains suck.)~
